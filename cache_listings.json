      "description": "1974 BMW E3 30s Manual:\r\n\r\nExquisitely Refurbished BMW 3.0L E3 Manual\r\n\r\nBehold a classic masterpiece, meticulously reengineered with it's vintage charm. This BMW 3.0L E3, now Stroked to 3500 cc capacity, a seamless conversion from automatic to manual transmission, offering an unparalleled driving experience. \r\n\r\nThe car has undergone an extensive overhaul, with a new clutch, gearbox, and differential—all fine-tuned to a shorter final drive ratio for improved response and agility. The prop shaft has been refurbished with new center bearings, and it rides on new shocks and rear wheel bearings. \r\n\r\nThe suspension system has been enhanced with new control arm bushes, tie rod ends, and center drag link. New drive shafts ensure smooth power delivery, while the stainless steel exhaust and new brakes with flexible hoses promise a symphony of performance. \r\n\r\nBraking is more responsive with new front discs, and the vehicle sits proudly on 7x14” copy Alpina wheels, enveloped in premium Michelin tires. The full tool kit is intact, and the exterior is complemented by an optional passenger door mirror, adding a touch of symmetry and style.\r\n\r\nUnderneath, the drive shafts and fuel tank have been overhauled, with the alternator and power steering pump meticulously refurbished.\r\n\r\nThis BMW is more than a car; it's a statement. Don't miss the chance to own a piece of automotive history.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact any of our sales people for further Information.\r\nThe Auto Agents:",
